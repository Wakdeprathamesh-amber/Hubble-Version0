# 🔍 Complete Flow Analysis & Test Cases

## ✅ FLOW 1: Create Ticket in Main Channel → Internal Channel

### Steps:
1. User posts message in **main channel** (e.g., H- Tech Problem)
2. Bot creates ticket in Google Sheet
3. Bot replies in **main channel thread** with buttons
4. Bot posts formatted card to **internal channel**

### Data Flow:
```
User message
  ↓
ticket_service.create_ticket()
  ├── Stores: ticket_id, requester_id, requester_name, status, priority, message
  ├── Custom fields: {requester_id: "U08S2KRG2F9"}
  └── Saves to Google Sheet
  ↓
slack_handler: Post to main thread
  ↓
slack_handler: Post to internal channel
  ├── Formats ticket card with all fields
  ├── Returns internal_message_ts
  └── Stores internal_message_ts in Sheet (Column N)
```

### Verification:
- ✅ Ticket created in Sheet (Row added)
- ✅ Thread reply in main channel
- ✅ Card posted in internal channel
- ✅ internal_message_ts stored in Sheet

### Status: ✅ WORKING (based on logs provided)

## ✅ FLOW 2: View & Edit from Main Channel

### Steps:
1. User clicks "View & Edit" button in **main channel thread**
2. Modal opens with ticket fields
3. User edits fields and clicks "Update"
4. Updates propagate to Sheet, main thread, and internal channel

### Code Path:
```
app.py: handle_view_edit_ticket_direct()
  ├── Gets ticket data
  ├── Builds modal with fields
  └── Opens modal
  ↓
modal_submission_handler.py: handle_dynamic_modal_submission()
  ├── Extracts submitted values
  ├── Updates Google Sheet
  ├── Posts update to main thread ✅
  └── Updates internal channel message ✅
```

### Pre-fill Check:
```python
# modal_builder.py
requester: ticket_data.get("requester_id") → Should show user
status: ticket_data.get("status") → Should show "Open"
assignee: ticket_data.get("assignee_id") → Should show user (if exists)
priority: ticket_data.get("priority") → Should show "MEDIUM"
description: ticket_data.get("message") → Should show original text
```

### Issues Found:
- ⚠️ **Requester pre-fill**: Works for NEW tickets (has requester_id), OLD tickets might not
- ⚠️ **Assignee pre-fill**: Works only if assignee_id stored in custom_fields

### Status: ✅ MOSTLY WORKING (new tickets), ⚠️ NEEDS assignee_id storage

## ✅ FLOW 3: View & Edit from Internal Channel

### Steps:
1. User clicks "View & Edit" button in **internal channel**
2. Modal opens with ticket fields (same as main channel)
3. User edits and submits
4. Updates propagate everywhere

### Code Path:
```
app.py: handle_internal_view_edit_direct()

### Steps:

### Code Path (BEFORE FIX):
```
app.py: handle_close_ticket_direct()

```

  └── Posts to main thread ✅
```

### Issue Found:

## 🐛 BUGS FOUND & FIXED

### 1. ✅ Close Ticket Doesn't Update Internal Channel
**Status:** FIXED (just added update_internal_channel_message call)

### 2. ⚠️ Assignee User ID Not Stored
**Issue:** When assigning via "Assign to Me", we store "@Name" but not user ID
**Impact:** Next time you edit, assignee field won't pre-fill
**Solution needed:** Store assignee_id in custom_fields

### 3. ⚠️ Old Tickets Won't Pre-Fill
**Issue:** Tickets created before our fix don't have requester_id/assignee_id
**Impact:** Modal shows empty for requester/assignee
**Solution:** Only affects old tickets, new ones work fine

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX

### Issue #1: Assignee ID Not Stored

When you use "Assign to Me" button, it stores:
```python
assignee_display = f"@{user_name}"  # Only stores @Name
```

Should store:
```python
assignee_display = f"@{user_name}"
custom_fields['assignee_id'] = user_id  # ALSO store user ID
```

**I'll fix this now...**
